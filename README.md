# SDG-Website
fully designed and developed 5-page website based on a single UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). This project must demonstrate the full frontend development process, starting from UI/UX design in Figma (with clear attention to user experience, accessibility, and aesthetics) to pixel-perfect HTML &amp; CSS implementation based on that design.
