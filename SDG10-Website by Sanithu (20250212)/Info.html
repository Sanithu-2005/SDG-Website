    <h3>Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities</h3>
    <p>Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) aims to reduce inequality within and among countries. It addresses disparities in income, social inclusion, and access to opportunities, recognizing that inequality is a barrier to sustainable development.</p>
    <h3>Targets and Indicators</h3>

        <li>Target 10.2: Promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status. Indicator: Proportion of people living below 50% of median income, disaggregated by sex, age, and disability status.</li>
        <li>Target 10.3: Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices.

        <li>Target 10.a: Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements. Indicator: Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff.</li>
        <li>Target 10.b: Encourage development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States, and landlocked developing countries. Indicator: Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and type of flow.</li>
        <li>Target 10.c: By 2030, reduce to less than 3% the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5%. Indicator: Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Progress and Challenges</h3>
    <p> Despite progress in some areas, inequality remains a significant challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. For instance, the pandemic led to increased unemployment and income disparities, highlighting the need for robust social protection systems and inclusive policies.
      Efforts to reduce inequality require comprehensive strategies that address the root causes of disparities, including discrimination, lack of access to quality education and healthcare, and economic exclusion. International cooperation and commitment to the SDGs are essential for achieving meaningful progress in reducing inequalities.</p>
